//! Simple IR bytecode emitter
//!
//! This module serializes a lowered `IrModule` into a compact, transportable
//! byte sequence. The format is intentionally simple (magic, version, ops),
//! suitable for testing and prototyping a bytecode runtime.

/// Serialize the provided IR module into a Vec<u8> containing the bytecode.
///
/// Format (little-endian):
/// - 4 bytes: magic: b"MSBC"
/// - 4 bytes: u32 version (1)
/// - 4 bytes: u32 op_count
/// - sequence of ops: each op is encoded as: 1 byte opcode + payload
///
/// The payload uses u32 for register/local indices and lengths, and
/// strings are encoded as u32 length + UTF-8 bytes.
